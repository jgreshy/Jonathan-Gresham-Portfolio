# Project 2 Overview: Using SQL and Tableau
## [**Kickstarter Campaigns: Global Success Patterns**](https://github.com/jgreshy/kickstarter)

- The data used was found on Kaggle and represents unique Kickstart Campaign records.
- The goal behind this analysis is to find the general trends behind successful/unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns. Using the analysis, Kickstarter can attract more backers to then faciliate more successful campaigns. This would result in more revenue for the company and could attract campaigns away from competitors such as Indiegogo.
